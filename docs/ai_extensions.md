# AI Extensions

This project focuses on local monitoring but it can be expanded with AI features.
The sections below outline possible integrations and the modules they require.

## Cloud APIs

- Connect to external machine learning services for image or data analysis.
- Sync local readings to a remote endpoint for long term storage.
- Fetch updates from a cloud dashboard via REST or MQTT.

Required modules:
- `cloud_client` providing HTTP or MQTT wrappers.
- `token_store` for managing credentials.

## Voice Assistant Hooks

- Enable voice control through a companion device or smart speaker.
- Handle commands such as "show humidity" or "set lighting schedule".

Required modules:
- `voice_adapter` to process audio commands.
- Updates to the existing `assistant` agent to route voice intents.

## Advanced Analytics

- Run on-device inference for predictive alerts.
- Combine historical data to suggest care instructions.

Required modules:
- `analytics_engine` for loading models and generating results.
- Extensions to `storage` for logging training data.

## Data Flow Overview

1. Sensors publish data to the core modules.
2. The analytics engine or cloud client processes the readings.
3. Results are routed back into the UI and voice assistant.
4. Processed data may optionally sync to a cloud service.
